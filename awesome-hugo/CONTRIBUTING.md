# Contributing Guide

1. Make sure you put things in the right category!
1. Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
1. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.


### Projects using Hugo

- Please only add sites that **do not** use themes, and preferably examples of great sites to inspire users.
- Please do add repositories where available.


### Resources

Official and unofficial resources for getting started with or using Hugo.

- Please only add projects that are active and maintained.

### Gists

Gists are succinct code snippets. Please only include things that are useful to many.

You can run [`awesome-lint`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-lint) against your changes, if you like.
