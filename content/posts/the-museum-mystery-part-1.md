She was standing on top of the Eiffel tower. She was wearing a black dress, in which she looked ravishing, as usual. She looked very happy, and was calling me towards her. I went towards her with glee. I was inches away from her as her lips parted and came towards mine. Then suddenly, she started singing "Scotty doesn't know" in a coarse male voice. I couldn't get understand a thing of what was happening. Then I realized it all....

I woke up with a start and noticed that my cellular phone was ringing. I answered the call.

"Good morning sir. Harvey here. Sorry to have woken you up at this time. But it's really urgent."
"Good morning Harvey. Go on." I replied, yawning.
"A new case has come up. I think you better come up to the Central Museum sir."
"Ok Harvey. Will be there."

I rushed to the bathroom and managed to brush my teeth and have a quick shower. I dressed up and started my black Jaguar. The roads were empty since it was only five in the morning. Being in the top few of the country's investigative agency did have its perks. But with it came a lot of responsibility too. I reached the museum in ten minutes. It was pretty crowded, with lots of police cars and policemen surrounding the entrance. I parked my car in a corner and went towards the entrance. The policemen at the entrance recognized me immediately and saluted me. I accepted the salute and entered the museum.

I saw Harvey, my deputy, standing near the curator's office talking animatedly on his phone. I went near him, and he immediately ended the call and came up to me.

"Good morning sir."
"Morning, Harvey. Tell me what happened."
"A robbery, sir, We don't have any clues."
"That's interesting. What was the object stolen?"
"The Renaissance Ruby. One of the most precious exhibits of the museum."
"Oh god. How did they manage to steal that? Isn't the museum monitored on CCTV cameras?"
"Yes sir. That is the most intriguing part. There was a power cut for about half a minute. But no one was allowed to leave or enter the museum during that time. When the power came back, the ruby was missing. And everyone who left the place was checked thoroughly. It wasn't crowded that much. But no one seemed to have stolen it. The whole museum has been searched. There has been no clues at all so far."

It seemed to be an easy case. I just had to interrogate all the people who were present inside the museum. And track down the suspect. Surely it would have to be one of them. I thought the case would be solved within one day. How wrong I was!
