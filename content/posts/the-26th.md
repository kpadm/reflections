No, no this is not my 26th post (though actually blogger displays this as my 26th in my dashboard, since I haven't published 4 other posts yet). This is about the date, the 26th, which I surmise from what I found is the unluckiest number for India.

I had this doubt ever since the Mumbai blasts occurred on November 26, 2008. My mind immediately went back to the tsunami, which also occurred on December 26, 2004 (I witnessed it firsthand in fact). So I did a bit of research on this, and what came up is really intriguing.

I will now give a list of tragedies and mishaps that have occurred on the 26th of a month.

November 26, 2008- Mumbai blasts and terrorist attack
July 26, 2008- Ahmedabad blasts
May 26, 2007- Guwahati blasts
July 26, 2005- Mumbai floods started
December 26, 2004- Tsunami
January 26, 2001- Gujarat earthquake

Each of these tragedies has caused widespread death and destruction in India. So is 26th really the devil's number for India? Should we be extra-cautious on the 26th of each month?
