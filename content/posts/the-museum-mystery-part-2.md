I walked into the curator's room. It was filled with press and media persons. They rose as I entered the room, and asked me to comment on the situation and about the suspects. I was in no mood to interact with the press, and therefore declined to comment, saying there will be an official press release soon.

"Have you detained all the people who were present inside the museum at the time of the robbery?" I asked Harvey.
"Yes, sir. They have all been asked to wait in a separate hall. We were waiting for you to start the interrogation."
"For how long have they been detained? And were they searched?"
"They haven't been allowed to go home yet. They have been here all through. And yes, they have all been searched. The whole place has been searched. The ruby was right under a CCTV camera, but it got switched off due to the power cut. There has been no fingerprints or clues yet."
"Okay. I would like to start the interrogation immediately. Arrange a room for me within five minutes."
"Done, sir. Here is the list of the people and their details."

I went through the list. There were ten people who were inside the museum at the time of robbery. All the people on the list were middle class people, three of them were employed with the government, a couple of them employed with the local bank, and the rest five were from the same family who had come on an evening trip. It was hard to guess who would be the suspect, and I decided that it would be clear only after the interrogation. Harvey was back within three minutes and lead me to the room. I asked him to allow the first person in. It was one of the two bank employees.

"Sit down." I said as he entered.
"Good morning, sir." he started cheerfully.
"Morning, Mr.Adams. Where do you work?"
"In the local branch of Churchwood Cooperative bank, sir." he replied.
"Did you come to the museum alone, Mr.Adams?"
"No sir. I came with my colleague, one Mr. Perry. We came here straight from the bank, sir."
"What was so important in the museum that you came here directly from your bank, Mr.Adams?" I asked him.
"Actually sir, we had something to talk. So we decided to walk to the museum and talk as we go around it."
"Talk about what?"
"My son, sir. I want him to enter an engineering college, but he wouldn't listen to me. So, I thought I would ask Mr.Perry to give him a piece of his mind."

The rest of the interrogation revealed nothing fruitful. I was convinced that neither Mr.Adams nor Mr.Perry would have committed the robbery. The interrogation of all the ten people took eleven hours, and I was thoroughly exhausted at the end of it. The three government employees were honest persons, and this was confirmed by the sources in the government. The family consisted of two adults and three children, and head of the family, Mr.Taylor, was working in a nearby car factory. They were immigrants from Austria, and Mr. and Mrs.Taylor had immigrated right after their marriage, looking for jobs. They had lived peacefully and had a good relationship with their neighbours. It was almost impossible to suspect them.

I was perplexed. The case was getting tougher, and the day was almost over, without any suspects. I decided to take the day off and go home and analyze the case in peace. I told Harvey that I would be back by the next day and left home.

I called her up as soon as I went home. I knew she would be furious at me, but I had a solid reason for not calling her. She answered the call on the first ring.

"What Mr.Detective, you don't have time to even talk to your girl friend?" she asked sarcastically.
"No dear, had an important case. Left early in the morning. Just came back home. Sorry." I tried to be as apologetic as possible.
"Ok ok. At least now you remembered to call. Do you know what happened today?" she asked me.
"No dear. What happened?"
"I went to the beauty parlor and had a hair cut. It looks so pretty." she said.
"You always look pretty, my love." I lied.
"Oh!" she blushed. And continued talking.
"And ya, my poor Jimmy!! He was having constipation till afternoon. Didn't know what happened to him. I then took him to the vet. It seems he had swallowed a rat. He was then operated on, and the rat was removed."
Jimmy was her pet dog, and she loved him very much.
"Oh that's bad darling. How is he now?" I asked her.
"He is fine now. Anyways, me feeling sleepy. Good night."
"Good night dear."

I prepared my supper, my mind considering the various possibilities in the case. Who could have done it? It must have been someone from the ten. But all of them seemed equally innocent. All the exits and windows remained closed. What other way could the culprit must have used to escape with the ruby? Who was the culprit? My mind was full of these questions as I dozed off to sleep. Who would have thought that one of the events that had occurred that day would lead me to the culprit?
