It has certainly been a while since I consistently created content on here. And I am not even sure if anyone is still reading my posts and/or stories. If you have been following this blog for a while (thank you!), you may notice some changes. I have finally decided to move off blogger/blogspot due to a couple of reasons. One, a lot of stuff that I had on there were broken (like images, tags and comments). Two, the layout was terrible for any kind of written content, and none of the default themes that blogger provides were of any use. And finally, I am not sure how long Google is going to keep blogger alive, considering the fact that they are exiting the domains business (sold it to Squarespace) and blogging in general has been slowly dying. Seriously, try to visit a random blogspot page and see how active it is. 

I have now moved my blog to github (powered by the excellent Hugo), and hopefully going to stay there for the near and far future. The blog now looks much cleaner and easier to read, with no distractions whatsoever. During the (manual) export of posts from blogger, I noticed how bad my writing was in the early days of this website. But I decided to make no changes to the content whatsoever, and decided to keep it as it is for posterity. Mainly becuase I am lazy, but also because it is who I was, and it is where I started from. And I did not want to change that. 

In case you stumbled upon this blog randomly, welcome! Hope you enjoy the various pieces of fiction you find on here. I can't promise that I am going to be super regular on posting content here, but I will try harder than I have done for the past few years to write more. Whoever you are, hope you have a great year.
